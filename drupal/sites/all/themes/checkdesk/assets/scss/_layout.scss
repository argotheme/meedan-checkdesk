// Core layout
// 
// This is the basic "Skeleton" that drives the "core" layout. 
// All layout is expressed as a ratio using span-columns() + container().
// This allows us to more easily redefine the layout in different context. 
// Example: create a new login form by changing $form_width when @including the login form mixin.
// We also combine this technique with media queries to resize based on browser width.
//
// Compatibility: untested

// Questions:
//
// Where will the sidebar go? - probably will only be active for some views of the liveblog, so on that page we will adjust the primary content to be ($total-cols - $sidebar-width)
// Which approach to breakpoints will we us? - Probably should be small calls to Susy's at-breakpoint. Need to keep the layout abstract so we can use it relculate.
