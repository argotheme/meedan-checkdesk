Amiri Font

Amiri is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and
other running text.

Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by
Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is
named.

The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the
beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of
elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces
that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital
typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.

Amiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic
typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly
available form.

Amiri is a free, open source project that everyone is encouraged to use and
modify. See the license for more details.
