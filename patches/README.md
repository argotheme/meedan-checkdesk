# Meedan Drupal Boilerplate Patches

Ideally the Druapl core and contrib modules should never be modified, ie: "hacked" (http://drupal.org/project/hacked).  However, realistically patches are often necessary to fix bugs and maintain a stable system.  Without proper organization it quickly becomes confusing which patches are applied to the system, and more importantly **why they are applied**.

For this reason, please keep a copy of each applied patch in this directory **and update PATCHES.md** with relavant notes.

See **PATCHES.md** for more information.
